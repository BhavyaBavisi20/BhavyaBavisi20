<!-- ======================= STORY INTRO ======================= -->

Welcome to my GitHub.

My journey began with a simple curiosity —  
**how does data learn to think?**

That curiosity slowly turned into writing Python scripts,  
training machine learning models,  
teaching systems to understand patterns,  
and finally building **end-to-end AI applications** 

Today, I enjoy transforming raw data into intelligence,  
ideas into working systems,  
and problems into **practical AI solutions**.

This GitHub is my workspace —  
where I learn, build, break, fix, and repeat
